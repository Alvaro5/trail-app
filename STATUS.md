# Trail App — Status

## Stack (current)
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind, Recharts (charting)
- Deployed: Vercel (auto-deploy from GitHub main)
- Pacing model: Minetti grade-adjusted cost

## Done
- Scaffold deployed live on Vercel
- GPX upload + parse (DOMParser → {lat, lon, ele}), with parser-error guard.
  Parse boundary now throws a typed `GpxError` (codes `invalid` / `no-track` /
  `too-few`) for the three bad-input cases; `App.tsx` catches it and shows a
  friendly inline message instead of producing NaN or crashing. Engine stays pure.
- "Try an example" button loads a bundled course (`public/example-imperial-trail.gpx`,
  the Imperial Trail) so a first-time visitor with no GPX sees the full output.
  Fetched lazily on click; runs through the shared `buildTrack` pipeline — the exact
  same path as a user upload.
- Cumulative distance (Haversine)
- Elevation smoothing + D+. Originally a point-count moving average (window 3);
  now a physical-length pipeline (see the elevation-system entry below). Reported
  D+ on 25 Bosses: 835 m raw → 969 m naive-after-resample → **808 m** with the
  hysteresis threshold (back inside official ~700–900). Imperial: 1426 → 1476 →
  **1193 m** (near the ~1130 billing). D+ is display-only; it does not feed time.
- Per-segment gradients (Δele / Δdist)
- Minetti grade-adjusted cost model, clamped to ±0.45 — verified against the 2002 paper
- Engine extracted to `src/lib/pacing.ts` (pure, no React); Minetti anchors + clamp +
  computeSplits behavior locked in Vitest (`npm test`)
- Total-time invariant test: Σ (paceSecPerKm × distanceKm) over splits === last
  split's elapsedSec, asserted per-km on a mixed run/descent/hike course. Replaces
  the cross-check lost when projectTime was deleted; locks the table columns to the
  projected finish so they can't silently drift apart
- Per-segment pace from cost ratio → projected finish time on screen
- Per-km splits table (km / grade / D+ / hike% / pace / elapsed)
- Run/hike transition: HARD SWITCH to power-hike above transition grade at VAM
  (not min(run,hike) — correct, since iso-effort run always "wins" at VAM 750)
- Tailwind dark dashboard UI; effort inputs as live fields + sliders (pace / VAM / gate / terrain)
- Terrain factor (single multiplier) accuracy knob — **default now ×1.00** (pure Minetti
  baseline on load; was silently ×1.20, moved the headline number, so reset to 1.00)
- Elevation profile chart (Recharts)
- **Validated on the real race GPX** (Imperial Trail, Fontainebleau): parses to
  68.75 km / 1426 m D+ raw (1476 m post-resample) — in the ballpark of the
  ~70 km / ~1130 m billing (billed D+ runs low). Pipeline proven end-to-end on a
  point-to-point course, not just the 25 Bosses loop.
- Docs: CLAUDE.md added (decisions, working style, do-not-list); README rewritten
  to current behavior; removed leftover Vite DEFAULT_README.
- **Self-calibration groundwork — timestamp capture.** `TrackPoint` gained an
  optional `time?` (epoch ms); `parseGpx` now reads the `<time>` child of each
  `<trkpt>` (ISO 8601 → epoch ms) when present, undefined when absent — course
  GPX files with no timestamps parse and run the forward model exactly as before.
  New pure fn `actualSegmentTimes(points)` returns per-segment elapsed seconds
  (parallel to gradients, length n−1), or **null if any point lacks a timestamp**
  (all-or-nothing: a partially-timed track can't anchor a fit and zero-filling
  would bias solved params fast). Tests added under a `happy-dom` env docblock
  (new dev-only dep, supplies DOMParser): timestamped track → correct positive
  segment times; no-time course → null + forward pipeline intact; partial timing
  → null. `actualSegmentTimes` is the ground-truth input the calibration fit will
  consume next.
- **Self-calibration fit v0 — one scalar.** `calibrateTerrainFactor(points, dists,
  grades, flatPace, vam, gate)` inverts the forward model against a recorded
  effort: runs pure Minetti (terrainFactor 1.0), then returns `actualTotal /
  predictedTotal`. Single division is *exact*, not approximate — terrainFactor
  scales every segment time uniformly, so predicted total is linear in it. This
  replaces the slider the user currently guesses with a measured number. Same
  all-or-nothing timing discipline: null if `actualSegmentTimes` is null (also
  null on a degenerate zero-movement course). Pure engine only — NOT wired into
  App.tsx; that's a later step. Test recovers ~1.15 from a track timed at exactly
  1.15× the model across mixed grades; no-time effort → null.
  - Honest limitations (recorded, not solved this session):
    1. **Stopped time** — aid-station / paused-watch / photo deltas inflate
       `actualTotal`, biasing the factor high. A moving-time filter belongs in
       `actualSegmentTimes` (drop near-zero-speed segments) before this division.
    2. **Single-effort overfit** — one race = one day's weather/legs/fueling. The
       real version should fit against several efforts, weighting recent ones more,
       not trust a lone finish time.
- **Resample to even spacing — gradient spikes fixed.** New pure fn
  `resampleEven(points, dists, intervalM)` re-stations the track every 10 m by
  linear interpolation (lat/lon/ele) before gradients, so near-coincident GPS
  fixes can't blow up Δele/Δdist. Slots in as
  `parseGpx → cumulativeDistances → resampleEven(10) → smoothElevation(3) →
  gradients` (now smoothElevationByDistance — see next entry); wired into App.tsx
  and `scripts/calibrate-scan.ts`. Geometry only —
  resampled points carry **no `time`**; the timing path (`actualSegmentTimes`)
  still runs on the raw, truly-timed points, so calibration is unaffected by
  design. Tests lock even spacing, linear-ramp→constant-gradient,
  endpoint/total-distance preservation, and degenerate inputs.
  - **Spike fix, measured.** Max |gradient| collapses: 25 Bosses 5414%→60%,
    Pajariel 325%→34%, quais 168%→18% (Imperial had no big spike, 54%→52%).
  - **Coastline / D+ shift is density-dependent — note this.** Window-3 smoothing
    spans `3 × spacing` meters, so resampling to 10 m changes its physical reach.
    On DENSE recordings (~2.5 m raw) it down-samples → slightly less D+
    (Pajariel 515→502, quais 134→113). On the SPARSE race files (~18–20 m raw) it
    UP-samples → the window now spans 30 m not ~60 m, retaining MORE D+:
    25 Bosses 835→969 m, Imperial 1426→1476 m. Accepted tradeoff for the 10 m
    choice; one side effect is 25 Bosses now sits just above the official
    ~700–900 band.
  - **Bonus — tighter calibration.** Removing spike-driven false hiking pulled the
    `calibrate-scan` factors from 1.015–1.087 to **1.048–1.095** (Pajariel hike
    fraction 13.3%→7.9%, quais 3.1%→0%). The hikeFraction-overstatement issue is
    now resolved in practice, not just bounded.
- **Elevation system — physical length scales (research-backed).** The literature
  (Strava, swisstopo, the arXiv "cumulative ascent meets Mandelbrot" paper) is
  clear that resampling fixes gradient spikes but NOT the coastline paradox: naive
  Σ(positive Δele) is noise-inflated and scale-dependent. Two new pure fns address
  the rest, each with an explicit metres-based knob, decoupled from grid density:
  - `smoothElevationByDistance(points, dists, windowM)` — centered MA over a fixed
    PHYSICAL window instead of a point count. On a 10 m grid, windowM=30 is exactly
    the old window-3 (unit-tested equality), so swapping it in is **time-neutral**
    (calibrate-scan factors unchanged: 1.092/1.095/1.048/1.087). Rule of thumb:
    keep windowM ≥ ~3× the resample interval or it under-smooths.
  - `cumulativeGain(eles, thresholdM)` — density-stable D+ via a hysteresis
    deadband: only bank a climb once it clears `thresholdM` above the last
    reference; sub-band wiggles (GPS noise) never count. `thresholdM = 0` reduces
    exactly to the naive sum (unit-tested), so it's a strict generalization.
  - **Wired:** App.tsx now uses interval 10 m, window 30 m, D+ threshold **5 m**
    (named constants at top of App.tsx, one-line tunable). 5 m chosen because it
    best matches published D+ (25 Bosses 808 m in the ~700–900 band; Imperial
    1193 m near the ~1130 billing) — naive was 969/1476, noise-inflated. Pajariel
    (real hills) barely moves (502→475), confirming the filter strips noise not
    signal. **Decision is yours** — change `D_PLUS_THRESHOLD_M` if you disagree;
    measured table: 25 Bosses 2 m→894 / 3 m→866 / 5 m→808; Imperial 1309/1278/1193.
  - Tests: window-3 equality, line-preserving interior, and threshold deadband
    (noise→0, real climb banked, valley re-anchoring, threshold-0 == naive).

- **Analytics — Umami Cloud (free tier, custom events included).** Script tag in
  `index.html` with `data-domains="gradepace.vercel.app"` so dev/localhost never
  records; `src/lib/analytics.ts` is a no-op-safe `track()` wrapper (undefined
  tracker / ad-blocker / dev all silently skip). Four events: `load-example`,
  `upload-gpx`, `gpx-error` (with source + error code — measures how many
  visitors bring route-only GPX files, which decides whether rtept support is
  worth building), `share-image` (with native-sheet vs download method; only
  counted after a completed share, not a dismissed sheet). Chosen over Vercel
  Analytics because the Hobby plan is pageviews-only (custom events are Pro).
  Site created at cloud.umami.is; the live website ID is in `index.html`.
  Verified live (visit + events in Realtime). Caveat, confirmed first-hand:
  ad-blockers (EasyPrivacy list) block `cloud.umami.is`, so counts are a floor —
  a chunk of a dev-leaning audience is invisible. Fine for funnel shape; don't
  read absolutes as true traffic. Fix if it ever matters: proxy the script
  through a first-party path (Vercel rewrite) or self-host.

- **Landing page opens on the full dashboard.** First visit auto-loads the
  bundled Imperial Trail course (ref-guarded mount effect, same `buildTrack`
  path as everything else), so a visitor from the pinned post sees the product
  instead of an empty upload form. Badged "EXAMPLE — Imperial Trail" until a
  user upload succeeds; the example button hides while the example is on
  screen and returns after an upload ("Back to the example"). Auto-load is
  tracked as `auto-example` — separate from the `load-example` click — so the
  intent metric stays honest; an auto-load failure shows NO error banner (the
  visitor did nothing), just the empty state. Header copy now leads with the
  product pitch ("most planners assume you run every hill") + a
  stays-in-your-browser privacy line instead of the feature list.

- **Route GPX support (`<rtept>` fallback) + no-elevation guard.** `parseGpx`
  now falls back to route points when a file has no `<trkpt>` — race organizers
  publish courses as routes, and a route paces exactly like an untimed track.
  Bundled decision: a file whose points ALL lack `<ele>` (common in route
  exports) throws a new `GpxError` code `no-elevation` instead of pacing a
  silently flat course — the friendly message says to re-export with elevation.
  Tests: route-only parses, `trkpt` preferred over `rtept` when both exist,
  waypoint-only still `no-track`, all-missing-ele → `no-elevation`.
- **Footer with backlinks.** "Built by Alvaro Serero … open source on GitHub" —
  closes the X-post → app → follow loop. Outbound clicks tracked via Umami
  `data-umami-event` attributes (`click-x`, `click-github`), no JS needed.

- **Self-calibration v1 — moving-time filter + UI.** Two pieces:
  1. Engine: `movingTimeSec(points, minSpeed=0.3 m/s)` — per-segment speed from
     the RAW points; segments slower than 0.3 m/s are stops (0.3 chosen because
     the slowest deliberate hiking the model produces — VAM 750 on the 45%
     clamp — is still ≈0.46 m/s horizontal; standing GPS jitter is far below).
     Catches both stop shapes (standing watch = tiny-Δdist segments; paused
     watch = one huge-Δt segment). `calibrateTerrainFactor` now divides MOVING
     time by predicted — this resolves honest-limitation #1 (stopped time).
  2. UI: "Calibrate from a real run" card — upload a recorded GPX, see
     "moving X of Y elapsed, model predicts Z → factor ×F", one click applies
     it to the terrain slider (widened to 0.8–1.6, step 0.01; default still
     ×1.00). Plausibility warning outside 0.85–1.5.
  - **Measured on the four real training runs** (was 1.048–1.095 on raw
    elapsed): quais ×0.993, pajariel ×1.013, bois ×1.062, campagne ×1.080.
    The flat quais run had 7½ min of traffic-light stops; filtered, Minetti
    predicts it within 30 s — the engine is near-exact on clean flat ground
    and the factor now measures terrain, not stops.
  - **Trap found, guarded in UI:** route exports (Strava route builder etc.)
    embed SYNTHETIC ~15 km/h timestamps — Imperial_Trail.gpx "fits" ×0.43.
    Timestamps existing ≠ timestamps real; hence the plausibility band. A
    real detector (constant-speed heuristic) is future work.
  - Analytics: `calibrate-run` (with factor), `calibrate-apply`,
    `calibrate-error` (with code).
  - Known: the factor is fitted against the CURRENT flat-pace/VAM/gate inputs;
    changing them afterwards makes it stale. Fine for v1; revisit if confusing.

- **Honest range around the projected finish (product-thesis item).** New pure
  fn `finishRange(likelySec, calibrated)`: center unchanged (the model's
  estimate — this is presentation, not a model change); band −8%/+10%
  uncalibrated, −5%/+7% after applying a measured factor. Grounding: day-of
  noise ≈4–9% on a 70k, plus terrain-guess spread (measured factors vary ±4%
  across the four calibration runs; a hand-set slider is worse). Asymmetric:
  races go long more often than short. Shown as "expect H:MM – H:MM" (no
  seconds — that would be false precision again) on the Projected-finish card
  (with a "· calibrated" tag) and on the share image under the hero time.
  Hand-moving the terrain slider clears the calibrated flag → band widens.
  Band constants exported from pacing.ts; tests lock both bands + narrowing.

- **Polish batch (first-visitor hardening).**
  - *Bundle split:* the Recharts chart moved to `src/ElevationChart.tsx`,
    loaded via `React.lazy` — main bundle no longer carries ~500 kB of chart
    library; the page paints before the chart chunk arrives (fixed-height
    Suspense fallback, no layout jump).
  - *Error boundary* (`src/ErrorBoundary.tsx`, wraps `<App/>` in main.tsx): a
    render error now shows a styled reload screen instead of a white page.
  - *Pace input honesty:* `parsePace` returns NaN on garbage instead of
    silently falling back to 6:00; the plan keeps the last VALID pace, the
    field turns red with "still using X/km". Calibration uses the same
    last-valid pace.
  - *Drag & drop:* dropping a .gpx anywhere on the page loads it (same code
    path as the file input). Non-.gpx drops get a friendly error.
  - *Share-title cleanup:* `Imperial_Trail-2025.gpx` → "Imperial Trail 2025"
    when prefilling the course name (feeds the share image).
  - *App smoke test* (`src/App.test.tsx`): renders the real `<App/>` in
    happy-dom with fetch mocked — locks the auto-load → example badge →
    dashboard wiring that unit tests couldn't see. Chart module stubbed
    (happy-dom has no layout engine).

- **Cold-start terrain prior — investigated, NOT shipped (negative result).**
  Tested three course-derivable signals against the four measured factors
  (`scripts/prior-scan.ts`, kept for re-testing): elevation roughness
  (mean |Δgrade| per 10 m), steep fraction (|grade|>12%), and bearing-change
  rate (horizontal twistiness). None correlates: the flat quais road shows
  MORE elevation roughness than the trail runs (urban GPS multipath), the
  twistiest course has the lowest factor, the steepest a ≈1.0 factor. Also
  systematic: race-course files carry smooth DEM elevations vs noisy GPS on
  recorded runs, so "roughness" measures elevation provenance, not terrain.
  Decision: default stays ×1.00; the asymmetric range (−8/+10%) is the honest
  cold-start story. Re-test when more calibrated efforts exist (post-race).
  Open one-line option (owner's call): set the uncalibrated default to the
  personal measured mean ≈×1.04.

- **Units toggle (km/mi).** Engine stays 100% metric; imperial is a display
  concern plus one engine knob: `computeSplits` gained `bucketMeters`
  (default 1000; 1609.344 in imperial → REAL per-mile splits, not relabeled
  km; total time invariant to bucketing, unit-tested). Toggle in the
  "Your pace" card converts the pace text in place (6:00/km ↔ 9:39/mi — whole-
  second rounding shifts the projection a few seconds, inherent to a text
  field), flips chart axes (ft/mi via converted data so ticks land round),
  stats, table headers, D+ (ft), VAM display (ft/h; slider still m/h
  internally), and the share card (`units` field). Default: en-US locale →
  imperial, else metric; persisted in localStorage (guarded — storage can
  throw in private browsing). `switch-units` analytics event.

- **Declutter pass (owner feedback: too much text on the main page).** Header
  pitch cut to ONE sentence; upload/privacy hint merged to one line; example
  badge text shortened; pace-field hint shortened; calibration card is now a
  collapsed `<details>` (summary shows "· applied ×N" once calibrated); share
  section reduced to one input+button row (no label, no explainer); range
  explainer shortened; splits table collapsed to 12 rows with a
  "Show all N splits" toggle. No behavior changes — copy and layout only.
- **Gradient-colored elevation profile** (was on Next — unblocked by the
  resample). The chart stroke is a horizontal SVG gradient with ~150 stops
  colored by local grade over a ±100 m window (metric profile, before unit
  conversion): blues = descent, emerald = runnable, amber/orange = climb,
  rose = hike-steep (≈ the 18% gate). Tooltip now shows elevation · grade.
  Area fill stays the subtle emerald fade.

- **Share card: grade-colored profile + preview harness.** The card's profile
  stroke now uses the same grade→color scale as the on-page chart, via a new
  shared `src/lib/gradeColor.ts` (single source, the two can't drift).
  Degenerate profiles fall back to solid emerald (a stop-less gradient would
  render an invisible line — guarded + tested). Verified visually with
  `scripts/render-card-preview.mjs` (npx tsx; renders the card to PNG via
  sharp without a browser — kept as a dev harness). Also: aria-labels on both
  file inputs.

- **Power-hike made visible (owner feedback: the header promises it, the app
  barely showed it).** Three changes, one idea:
  1. Chart rose = "the plan walks here": the rose band is now driven by the
     ACTUAL hike gate (prop from the slider), not a fixed 15%; a tight ±30 m
     check overrides the ±100 m band smoothing so short walls get marked; the
     tooltip appends "· power-hike". Gradient stops are now run-length
     encoded on a 30 m grid (stops at color TRANSITIONS) — uniform ~460 m
     sampling was skipping right over Fontainebleau's 30–100 m hike walls,
     so the feature was invisible on the exact course that motivated it.
  2. Legend under the chart (descent / runnable / climb / power-hike), from a
     shared `GRADE_LEGEND` next to the color scale so they can't drift.
  3. Fourth stat card: "Power-hike — X mi/km · N% of the course walked."
     Share card takes the gate too (`hikeAboveGrade`).

- **Shareable plan links.** "Copy link" (next to Share image) encodes the
  effort inputs in the URL hash (`#p=6:00&vam=750&gate=18&tf=1.08&u=metric`);
  on load the hash overrides defaults (validated + clamped; malformed → plain
  defaults). Deliberate limits: an uploaded GPX can't travel by link, and the
  `calibrated` flag never travels — the recipient didn't calibrate, so they
  get the honest wide band even if the sender's factor was measured.
  Clipboard-blocked fallback drops the hash into the address bar. Smoke test
  locks the restore path. `copy-link` analytics event.
- **og.png now generated FROM the product.** `scripts/gen-og.mjs` (run with
  npx tsx) renders the real share card from the bundled example course
  through the real engine pipeline — colored profile, honest range,
  power-hike stat — so the social preview can't drift from the app.
  `public/og.svg` (the old hand-made design) deleted.

- **Multi-run calibration (closes honest-limitation #2, single-effort
  overfit).** The calibration card now takes SEVERAL recorded runs (multiple
  file select, incremental adds, per-run remove). Design upgrade over v1:
  each run stores its geometry (dists/grades) + fixed moving time, and the
  factor is RE-DERIVED from the current pace/VAM/gate on every render — fits
  can never go stale when inputs change (the old staleness caveat is gone).
  Apply uses the MEDIAN of plausible fits (new `median()` in pacing.ts,
  tested; robust to one bad file/day), implausible runs stay visible but
  excluded, and the run list shows date/distance/moving time per fit with
  the spread printed next to the apply button. Verified live with all four
  real runs + the synthetic-timestamp route file: ×0.99/×1.01/×1.06/×1.08
  fitted, route excluded at ×0.43, median ×1.04 applied → Imperial 7:35:59,
  range 7:13–8:08. Note: the measured median (×1.04) equals the personal
  mean previously flagged as the open cold-start-default question.
  `calibrate-apply` event now carries the run count.

- **Owner-directed batch (2026-07-19):**
  1. *Steep showcase course:* `public/example-25-bosses.gpx` — the owner's own
     25 Bosses recording, timestamps + sensor extensions stripped (geometry
     only, nothing personal; cleanest possible rights). 15.16 km / ~808 m D+,
     42% of distance >12% grade — the power-hike showcase. Example switcher
     buttons offer whichever bundled course isn't on screen; badge + analytics
     carry the course key.
  2. *Uncalibrated default terrain factor ×1.00 → ×1.04* (owner decision).
     ×1.04 is the measured MEDIAN across the four calibrated real runs — the
     cold-start default is now data, not a blind 1.0. Moves the uncalibrated
     headline (example: 7:17:59 → ~7:36). og.png regenerated to match.
  3. *Layout for big screens:* container max-w-3xl → max-w-5xl (was a narrow
     stripe on a 27" 1440p), inline chart 160 → 288 px tall, plus a
     fullscreen chart overlay ("Expand"/"Agrandir": backdrop/Escape closes,
     full-height profile + legend) for studying a course.
  4. *Units switch clarified:* labeled "Units/Unités", bigger targets,
     aria-pressed.
  5. *i18n EN/FR:* all UI strings in `src/lib/i18n.ts` (typed off the English
     table so the languages can't drift; interpolations are functions).
     Default from navigator.language (fr→FR), persisted (`gp-lang`), EN|FR
     toggle in the header, `<html lang>` kept in sync, run-list dates
     localized. Share-card image deliberately stays English (single brand
     surface). `switch-lang` analytics event.
  - Light-theme toggle: NOT in this batch (dark-only today); queued as its
    own pass — touches every color class.

- **Light theme.** Dark stays the brand default; light is a Tailwind v4
  custom variant (`@custom-variant light` in index.css, driven by a `light`
  class on `<html>`). Components carry dark styles unprefixed + `light:`
  overrides; repeated clusters are shared constants (cardClass, inputClass,
  btnSecondaryClass, alertClass) so the themes can't drift per-instance.
  Sun/moon toggle next to EN|FR; preference saved (`gp-theme`), else follows
  `prefers-color-scheme`. Chart grid/tooltip colors via a `theme` prop (SVG
  attrs can't use CSS variants). Share card stays dark always (brand
  surface). `switch-theme` analytics event. Verified both themes live.
- **Repo renamed trail-app → grade-pace** (owner): git remote, package.json
  name, and the footer GitHub link updated to
  github.com/Alvaro5/grade-pace.

- **UI polish pass (owner feedback: glyph buttons + badge pill read as
  unfinished; wanted motion).**
  - `src/icons.tsx`: hand-rolled stroke SVG icons (sun/moon/upload/expand/
    close/chevron + the brand LogoMark) replacing ☀ ☾ ⤢ ✕ text glyphs that
    rendered as emoji or shifted baseline per platform.
  - Native file inputs ("Choose File / No file chosen" — unstylable AND
    English-only in the FR UI) → styled label-buttons with the upload icon
    ("Upload GPX / Importer un GPX", "Add recorded runs / Ajouter des
    sorties").
  - Example pill → quiet editorial label (small emerald caps + sentence).
  - Header: LogoMark tile beside the wordmark (same motif as share card).
  - Motion: dashboard fades up on course load (keyed per course), details
    content eases in, animated chevrons replace native markers, fullscreen
    chart fades in, transition-colors on every interactive element,
    focus-visible rings throughout; all gated by prefers-reduced-motion.
  - Shared btnPrimary/btnSecondary/focusRing constants unify every button.
  - Projected-finish card gets an emerald accent border (the hero number).
  Verified in both themes and both languages.

- **UI detail pass #2.**
  - *Chart uses its panel:* padded explicit Y domain (min−8%…max+8%) instead
    of the 0-anchored axis that flattened every hill on courses living at
    altitude; Area baseline follows the domain floor. Path animation OFF —
    it silently broke rendering with custom domains on ~7k points in
    Recharts, and it re-played on every keystroke anyway (page-level fade
    covers the entrance).
  - *Pace input has its unit inside the field* (min/km · min/mi suffix,
    larger text) — the app's one important input now reads as a unit-aware
    control.
  - *Sticky opaque table header* — headers survive "show all 70 splits".
  - *Locale thousands separators* for elevation numbers (1,193 / 1 193).
  - *Share bar icons* (image/link/check states) + active:scale press feel on
    primary/secondary buttons.
  - *theme-color meta follows the theme* so mobile browser chrome matches.

- **UI detail pass #3.**
  - *Effort sliders live on the desktop:* on lg+ the three knobs (VAM, gate,
    terrain) render as a 3-column grid inside the pace card — that card was
    mostly empty space, and these ARE the product's controls. Below lg they
    stay behind the "Advanced settings" toggle (now controlled state with a
    rotating chevron; native details replaced there).
  - *Chart tooltip shows the plan's pace* for the split under the cursor
    (`paceLabelAt` prop: App maps course-km → split pace in active units) —
    hovering now answers "what will I be doing here", making the chart the
    actual planning surface. Verified: "317 ft · +2% · 10:27/mi".

- **Aid stations ("ravitaillements") with projected arrival times.** Free-text
  positions in the active unit ("17, 33, 47", lenient parsing, capped at 30,
  clipped to course length). Rendered as: dashed R1/R2/… ReferenceLines on
  both chart views; chips under the chart showing each station's PROJECTED
  arrival (elapsed time interpolated inside the containing split — the value
  the roadbook can't give); green R-badges on the matching splits-table rows.
  Positions convert on the units toggle like the pace field, and travel in
  shared plan links (`rav` hash param, metric-canonical; smoke-tested).

- **Aid stations auto-detected from GPX waypoints.** Investigated first:
  the GPX spec has `<wpt>` for exactly this, but NONE of the project's 11
  files carry any (Strava/Komoot route exports never do; RideWithGPS/
  OpenRunner/LiveTrail files sometimes do) — so this is a bonus signal on
  top of manual entry, not a replacement. Engine: `parseGpxWaypoints`
  (never throws — waypoints are auxiliary) + `nearestTrackKm` projection
  with a 200 m off-course rejection; both unit-tested. App: `buildTrack`
  projects waypoints, drops start/finish markers (<200 m from either end),
  and a course load pre-fills the ravitaillements field (still editable);
  a course without waypoints clears stale entries, EXCEPT the first-visit
  auto-load so hash-shared stations survive. Verified end-to-end with a
  synthetic 4-waypoint file: the 2 real stations auto-filled with ETAs,
  the départ marker and a 9 km-away parking waypoint were rejected. Known
  limitation (documented in the engine): nearest-point projection can pick
  the wrong passage on out-and-back courses — hence always-editable text.
  `aid-autofill` analytics event.

- **Course map (Leaflet + OpenTopoMap).** New `src/CourseMap.tsx`, lazy like
  the chart (own 44 kB gzip chunk; main bundle untouched). Topo tiles suit
  the trail context; attribution per license (OSM contributors, SRTM,
  OpenTopoMap CC-BY-SA). The route renders as RLE-colored polylines using
  the SAME grade scale + hike-gate as the profile — rose on the map = "the
  plan walks here" everywhere. Start/finish endpoint dots (i18n tooltips),
  aid stations as amber markers whose tooltips carry the R-number + distance
  + PROJECTED arrival (reuses aidStops). Details: scroll-wheel zoom off (the
  map mid-page would trap page scroll); aid markers in their own layer so
  editing stations never re-fits the bounds; `relative z-0` wrapper because
  Leaflet's internal panes (z≈400) would otherwise paint over the
  fullscreen-chart overlay (z-50). Map mocked in the app smoke test
  (happy-dom has no layout). Tiles are the app's second external runtime
  dependency (after Umami) — OpenTopoMap is free/fair-use; swap to a keyed
  provider if traffic ever makes that impolite.

- **Map fullscreen + chart↔map hover sync.**
  - The map gets the same "Agrandir" treatment as the chart (overlay button
    on the card, portal-to-body fullscreen, Escape/backdrop closes; the
    Escape handler now closes whichever overlay is open).
  - Hovering the elevation profile mirrors the position as an emerald dot on
    the map — the profile answers "what will I be doing", the map now answers
    "where is that". Wiring: chart reports metric km via Recharts v3's
    `activeLabel` (NOT `activePayload` — v3 removed it from the chart-level
    mouse state; first attempt silently did nothing, caught by DOM
    inspection); App keeps a hoverKm state with a 50 m dead-band + functional
    bail-out so pointer-moves don't thrash renders; the map moves ONE
    reusable non-interactive circleMarker rather than recreating layers.

- **Hover-sync jank fix (owner feedback: chart tooltip stuttered).** Root
  cause: the hover position was React state with a 50 m dead-band — on a
  70 km course that's ~1 px of chart, so nearly every pointer-move
  re-rendered the dashboard, rebuilt the chart's 7k-point data and restarted
  the tooltip's slide animation. Fix: (1) the chart→map hover is now an
  IMPERATIVE bridge — CourseMap registers its marker-mover (one reusable
  circleMarker, setLatLng) and the chart calls it directly; React never
  renders on hover. (2) Tooltip position animation off — it snaps to the
  cursor. Verified via a temporary dev hook driving the bridge (km 10/50 →
  correct marker moves, null → removed); the browser-automation session
  stopped delivering hover events entirely mid-verification (even on the
  previously-verified commit), so final smoothness feel is confirmed on
  real hardware by the owner.

- **Strava-grade map suite (owner request, Strava's map as the reference).**
  - *Basemap switcher* — Terrain (OpenTopoMap, still the default) / Standard
    (OSM) / Satellite (Esri World Imagery) / Hybrid (Esri imagery + Esri
    Boundaries&Places labels), all keyless, config in `src/lib/basemaps.ts`.
    Choice persists (`gp-basemap`) and is LIFTED to the dashboard so the
    inline and fullscreen map instances stay in sync. Tile swap is its own
    effect — route/aid/hover vectors never rebuild. Zoom ceiling follows the
    active set (`setMaxZoom` — OpenTopo stops at 17, others 19; forgetting
    this shows blank tiles). Attribution follows each layer automatically.
  - *Scroll-wheel zoom only while hovering* the map (created with
    `scrollWheelZoom:false`, enabled on map `mouseover`, disabled on
    `mouseout`) — page scroll is safe, Strava behavior. Verified via the
    dev-only `window.__gpMap` handle: enabled() flips false→true→false
    around hover. (Synthetic wheel deltas couldn't move the zoom in the
    automation session — Chrome suppresses animation frames in occluded
    windows, so animated zooms stall; `setView(..., {animate:false})` worked
    instantly. Real scrolls on visible hardware are fine.)
  - *POI overlay* (drinking water / toilets / viewpoints from OpenStreetMap
    via Overpass, `src/lib/pois.ts` + tests). OPT-IN per session and not
    persisted — the app promises the GPX never leaves the device, so only a
    padded bounding box is ever sent, never track points; corridor filtering
    (≤200 m from the route, reusing haversine) runs client-side. Endpoint
    fallback chain (overpass-api.de → private.coffee → maps.mail.ru) with
    15 s per-endpoint timeouts — exercised live during verification: the
    main endpoint 504'd and a mirror delivered. Bbox area guard (2500 km²)
    refuses continent-sized queries with a friendly note. Fetch state lives
    in the dashboard so toggling fullscreen never refetches; new course
    aborts + resets. Fontainebleau bbox: 54 POIs → corridor-filtered pins.
  - *Scale bar* (`L.control.scale`, bottom-left) in the active display unit.
  - *Unmistakable start/finish*: divIcon inline-SVG markers — emerald ▶
    start, checkered-flag finish — white ring + shadow, readable on all four
    basemaps. On loop courses they stack at the same spot (finish on top).
  - *On-map controls are React* (siblings of the Leaflet div inside a new
    wrapper, `pointer-events-none` column with `pointer-events-auto` chips) —
    no `L.Control`/DomEvent plumbing, i18n + light/dark for free. The inline
    expand button moved into the map's control stack (`topRightSlot` prop).
    Wrapper keeps the `relative z-0` stacking fix; the Leaflet div gets
    explicit `z-0` so its internal panes flatten below the `z-10` chips.

- **Nutrition plan (owner request: carbs, calories, electrolytes, water "at
  each moment of the race").** Pure lib `src/lib/nutrition.ts` (+8 tests):
  hourly targets × each leg's PROJECTED duration — the legs partition the
  race at the aid-station ETAs (start → R1 → … → finish; no stations = one
  leg), so amounts follow time, not distance: a slow climb-heavy leg gets
  proportionally more. Defaults sit mid-band of published guidance — carbs
  70 g/h (60–90 ultra band), fluid 500 ml/h (400–750, heat-scaled), sodium
  450 mg/h — sliders 30–120 / 250–1000 / 300–1200 (sodium range wide on
  purpose: sweat sodium varies 3–4×; hint clarifies elemental sodium vs
  salt, 1 g salt ≈ 390 mg Na). UI: collapsed `<details>` card above the
  splits table — three sliders + per-leg table (duration/carbs/fluids/
  sodium/kcal), totals row, ≈gels equivalent (25 g each), one-line
  disclaimer. Fluid displays ml/L (fl oz in imperial), FR/EN. Rates travel
  in the share link (`nc`/`nfl`/`ns`, validated to slider bounds, written
  only when ≠ default). Kcal = carbs × 4 — deliberately carbs-only (fat/
  protein intake isn't what limits ultra performance mid-race).
  Verified live: 7:35:30 projection → 531 g / 3.8 L / 3420 mg / 2126 kcal
  totals, leg partition matches ETAs (checked against hand math).

- **Premium-feel polish batch.** Lazy-chunk Suspense fallbacks are now
  skeleton shimmers (`animate-pulse` blocks, both themes) instead of blank
  boxes; `<details>` cards animate open smoothly where supported
  (`interpolate-size: allow-keywords` + `::details-content` height
  transition — progressive enhancement, instant-open elsewhere, disabled
  under prefers-reduced-motion); range sliders get a pointer cursor, a
  taller hit area, and a visible focus ring (kept native accent styling —
  full custom thumbs would lose the progress-fill look).

- **Owner feedback round (2026-07-19), seven items in one sweep:**
  - *Nutrition "leg" confusion + broken-looking single-row table.* Renamed
    to "segment" (EN; FR keeps "tronçon"), the intro now defines it inline
    ("the stretch between two aid stations"), the redundant Total row is
    hidden when there's only one segment, and an emerald hint explains that
    adding aid stations breaks the table into per-segment rows.
  - *Sliders rebuilt* as fully custom controls (`.gp-range`): slim rounded
    track, emerald progress fill driven by a CSS var set from the value
    (native accent-color can't do this cross-browser), white ringed thumb
    that scales on hover/press with a soft halo, Firefox pseudo-elements
    included, focus ring kept, reduced-motion respected.
  - *POI speed*: endpoints now RACE in parallel (Promise.any, losers
    aborted) instead of failing over sequentially — the wait is the fastest
    healthy mirror, not the sum of dead ones (the primary 504'd through the
    whole build session; sequential cost 8-15 s before the first mirror was
    even tried). Retry after an error resets to idle so re-toggling refetches.
  - *More POI kinds* (Strava-inspired): cafés, springs, shelters, parking,
    picnic sites join water/toilets/viewpoints — 8 kinds, hue-coded icons.
    Query switched from node-only to `nwr` + `out center 600`, because
    parking lots / toilet blocks / picnic sites are usually mapped as AREAS
    (node-only silently missed them). Fontainebleau: 12 pins → 28.
  - *Buttons*: primary/secondary get soft shadows + tuned hover/active;
    "Show all splits" is now a centered pill with a rotating chevron and a
    gradient fade over the last visible rows that signals "more below".
  - *New brand mark*: the old generic trend-line read as AI slop (owner).
    Now a mountain profile drawn in the app's own grade colors (emerald
    runnable → amber climb → rose steep → sky descent) — the product's
    core visual compressed into a line. Applied everywhere: header, favicon,
    share card, og.png + apple-touch-icon (regenerated via gen-og.mjs).
  - *Em dashes banned from all UI copy* (owner style rule, now noted in
    i18n.ts header): every EN/FR string rewritten with periods/colons/
    commas; index.html title+metas, ErrorBoundary, share title, and table
    placeholders (— → ·) included. En dashes remain ONLY in numeric ranges
    ("60–90 g/h", "6:59 – 8:21"), which is standard typography.
  - *Race-day plan export* (`src/lib/planSheet.ts` + tests): "Export PDF"
    in the share bar renders the ENTIRE plan as a self-contained printable
    document in a new tab — brand header with the projected finish + range,
    stat chips, settings line, grade-colored profile SVG with km gridlines
    and R# aid markers, aid-station ETA table, nutrition table, and the
    full pacing table — then hands it to the browser's print dialog (save
    as PDF, or paper to tape to a bottle). Follows the active language;
    print CSS repeats table headers across pages; pop-up-blocked case gets
    a friendly error. Verified in-browser on the Imperial plan (69 rows,
    FR). Analytics: `export-sheet`.

- **Race logistics (roadmap batch 1): dwell, start time, cutoffs.**
  New pure `src/lib/logistics.ts` (+18 tests), deliberately OUTSIDE the
  engine: calibration models MOVING time (dwell threading through
  computeSplits would mis-calibrate every fit), and the honest range scales
  moving time only (dwell is a chosen constant ADDED after the band, never
  multiplied).
  - *Stop time*: minutes per aid station, **default 3 min (owner decision:
    zero-dwell plans are systematically optimistic; the headline moves only
    once stations are set** — the auto-loaded example has none, so the
    landing number is unchanged). Folded into everything downstream:
    arrivals (earlier stations only; strict `<`, arriving at a station
    hasn't spent its own dwell), finish (+n×dwell), range endpoints, splits
    elapsed (boundary epsilon so a station exactly on a km edge counts),
    nutrition legs (partition on ADJUSTED arrivals; a leg includes the dwell
    at its start station — intake at the R1 stop fuels the R1→R2 leg, and a
    12 h day needs 12 h of fuel), share PNG, PDF sheet (depart column when
    dwell > 0).
  - *Start time* (optional "H:MM" 24h): every ETA gains a wall-clock twin —
    chips, hero ("arrivée ≈ 15:44"), splits elapsed suffix, PDF. Wraps past
    midnight; rounds to the nearest minute, matching fmtClockShort, so the
    two forms can never disagree by one.
  - *Cutoffs* (elapsed "H:MM" per station, course order; input appears only
    once stations exist): rose chip + line when the central arrival misses
    the barrier, amber when only the slow end of the range does. Honest
    math: `slowArrive = movingPart × (rangeHigh/central) + dwellPart` — the
    dwell constant is never scaled by the uncertainty ratio (unit-tested).
  - *Hash*: `dw` (when ≠ 3), `st`, `co` (written only when every token is
    valid — a partial list would silently shift the station↔cutoff pairing
    for the recipient). Cutoffs are elapsed, hence unit-free.
  - Verified live on Imperial (17/33/47 + 8:00 start + 2:00/4:00/5:00
    cutoffs): finish 7:35:30 → 7:44:30 (+3×3 min), range 7:08 – 8:30,
    R2 ≈ 3:39 (3:36 moving + R1 dwell), R3 rose at 5:18 vs 5:00, clocks
    hand-checked. 105 tests total.

## Next
- **Optional elevation polish** (only if it earns its keep): expose
  `D_PLUS_THRESHOLD_M` / `SMOOTH_WINDOW_M` as UI controls; or try a Savitzky-Golay
  smoother (preserves climb peaks better than a box MA — the research flagged it,
  but it's harder to explain and the box MA is fine for now).
- Calibration: decide a believable terrain factor for Fontainebleau. New data
  point: the four real-run fits now span ×0.99 (flat road) to ×1.08 (campagne
  trails) with stops filtered — Fontainebleau sand/rocks plausibly ~1.05–1.10.
  Gut-check against the 68.75 km finish (7:17 @1.00 vs ~7:52 @1.08).
- Calibration next steps: fit against several efforts (weight recent ones) not
  a lone run; synthetic-timestamp detector (route exports at constant speed).
- Fatigue-fade model — ONLY after a second calibration point exists (known split
  or past race time). Do not fit terrain + fatigue against one finish time.
- Gradient-colored profile chart — now unblocked by the resample (gradients are
  clean); clamp grade for display.
- Bundle ~530 kB (Recharts heavy) → code-split the chart if load time matters
- Polish: pace stepper, hover tooltips on splits, mobile layout

## Known issues
- Per-km splits don't split the segment straddling a 1000 m boundary, so each km is
  ~1000–1020 m and distanceKm drifts <2% above 1.0. Principled fix = proportional split at
  the boundary; deferred for v0. Interim: the final partial km shows its actual distance.
- parseGpx forward-fills missing <ele>; fine for clean files, revisit if the messier
  September race file has long elevation gaps.

## Fixed (was a known issue)
- Gradient spikes (saw +3722%) from near-coincident GPS points — fixed by
  `resampleEven` (10 m even spacing before gradients). Max |gradient| on test
  tracks now <35%.
- Hike gate overstating hikeFraction from a surviving GPS spike above the
  transition grade — resolved by the resample (no spikes clear the gate now;
  measured hike fractions dropped, e.g. quais 3.1%→0%).

## Open decisions
- PWA later; native/watch only if validated
